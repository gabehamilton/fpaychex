I eat paychex for breakfast.

Our time tracking system is dumb. It should perform one mildly useful function which is to track time off
and let people know if everyone is trying to take the same time off. Instead it has a ridiculously convoluted interface
for entering all the time you work, which should be no more & no less than 8 hours per day.  And that's the *express*
interface.

Hence this new frontend.
